You can use grunt to watch and compile the LESS files, from the theme
directory:
First time install the local node_modules with "npm install".
Then just use "grunt" to watch and compile the LESS files when you
have grunt-cli installed.

Install node.js from nodejs.org, then from the theme directory use the
following commands

npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt

The npm installs only need to be done once on your system, thereafter you
just need to run grunt to watch the LESS directory for changes.
